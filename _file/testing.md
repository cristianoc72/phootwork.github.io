For testing your implementations, `phootwork/file` works very nice with [mikey179/vfsStream](https://github.com/bovigo/vfsStream).
Use `vfsStream` to test your own package (so is `phootwork/file`).

Head over to [vfs.bovigo.org](http://vfs.bovigo.org/) for the documentation on how to use `vfsStream`.
